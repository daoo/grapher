Fixed point instead of floats

Nodes instead of balls
  data Node a =
    pos :: Vector2 Int
    vel :: Vector2 Int
    mass :: Int
    charge :: Int
    data :: a

More graph focused backend
  class (Monad a) => Backend a where
    drawNode :: Node b -> a ()
    drawEdge :: Node b -> Node b -> a ()
